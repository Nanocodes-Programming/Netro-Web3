## Documentation: Cryptocurrency Address Generator

This Python script `accounts.py` is designed to generate cryptocurrency addresses for various blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Tron (TRC), and litecoin. It leverages different libraries and utilities to create addresses based on a given user number.

### Dependencies

The script requires the following dependencies:

- `eth_account`: Used for Ethereum-related operations like generating Ethereum addresses.
- `bitcoinlib`: Utilized to handle Bitcoin-related operations such as converting private keys to Bitcoin addresses.
- `tron_address_converter`: Used to convert Ethereum addresses to Tron addresses.
- `base58`: Required for encoding and decoding base58 data (commonly used in cryptocurrency addresses).
- `web3`: Used for Ethereum-related functionalities, including generating private keys from a mnemonic seed phrase.

### Function: `get_accounts(user_number)`

This function takes a `user_number` as input and generates cryptocurrency addresses for different blockchains.

1. **Private Key Generation**
   - The private key is generated using the `get_private_key(user_number)` function, which derives a private key from a mnemonic seed phrase using the `web3` library.

2. **Ethereum (ETH) Address**
   - The Ethereum address is derived from the private key using `eth_account.Account.from_key(private_key)`.

3. **Bitcoin (BTC) Address**
   - The private key is converted to bytes and then used with `bitcoinlib` to generate a Bitcoin address (`privkey_to_address(btc_private_key)`).

4. **Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Address**
   - Similar to Ethereum, the BSC address is generated using `eth_account.Account.from_key(private_key)`.

5. **Tron (TRC) Address**
   - The Ethereum address is converted to a Tron address using `TronConverter.from_hex(eth_address)`.

6. **litecoin Address**
   - The private key is encoded in base58 format using `base58.b58encode(private_key)` and then decoded to extract the public key (`keypair[32:]`). The litecoin address is derived from the public key.

### Utility Function: `get_private_key(user_number)`

This function generates a private key based on a `user_number` using a predefined mnemonic seed phrase (`seed_phrase`). It uses the `web3` library to derive a child key from the seed based on the provided account path (`m/44'/60'/0'/0/{user_number}`). The private key is returned as a hexadecimal string.

### Usage

To use the `get_accounts(user_number)` function:

1. Provide a `user_number` (an integer) as input.
2. Call `get_accounts(user_number)` to obtain a dictionary containing cryptocurrency addresses for Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, and litecoin.

Example:
```python
user_number = 123
addresses = get_accounts(user_number)
print(addresses)
```

### Notes

- Ensure all required dependencies (`eth_account`, `bitcoinlib`, `tron_address_converter`, `base58`, `web3`) are installed before running the script.
- The script assumes a specific mnemonic seed phrase (`seed_phrase`) for private key generation. Modify this seed phrase and account path (`account_path`) as needed for your use case.

This documentation provides an overview of how the `accounts.py` script works to generate cryptocurrency addresses across multiple blockchains based on a user-provided number.
